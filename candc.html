Israel and Palestine Project Brief<br> </br>


	For my project I am creating a website that allows people to better understand the conflict going on in Israel and Palestine and to hear first hand example of people from each of these regions. My application will make it easy to receive a non-biased view point on the conflict. From what I have gaged, not much information exists about this conflict without a deep seeded bias for one side or the other. This makes it very hard for people to have opinions on the matter that they truly resonate with. I do not necessarily hope to persuade anyone into believing that they need to choose a side. In fact I hope to express that there are always to sides to a story and that perhaps fighting for one side isnâ€™t always best practice.<br> </br>
	My site will use a series of interactions to help create an immersive experience that makes learning about heavy topics more engaging and accessible. The scroll through of maps will help people better understand the geography that surrounds the conflict. Geography plays a huge role in the tensions between the two nations. Scrolling down, one would find the first hand stories from individuals in the conflict. They will be able to hear from people on both sides. In a perfect world I would like to create a database where individual users could add their own stories to the site to build a larger collective of information about the conflict. The stories will have animated people that make it seem more interactive. The voices will speak and be written in text so that they are accessible for those hard of hearing or the visually impaired.<br> </br>
	Scrolling down more will be a full overview of the history of the conflict and an FAQ. I believe most people have generalized questions about what is going on but do not want to read an entire article about it. Attention span in individuals has decreased immensely and I believe that if I made an easy to use FAQ page then more people would be able to be informed about this serious topic.<br> </br>
	My target audience for this website is those who feel the need to learn more about the conflict occurring in the Middle East. I would also like this to be a safe space for those who are experiencing the trauma first hand to read other experiences and know they are not alone. In an over idealistic world, this site would be a way to help both Israelis and Palestinians to see the humanity in the other side. I realize this is a lofty goal and may be out of my jurisdiction of topics to involve myself with but perhaps this could be a jumping off point for others who are more entitled to have this conversation than I am.
	The contested borders of Israel and Palestine is an ongoing series of violence and human rights violations. It is our job to understand the strife of others and do what we can to help them. I hope this site can bring clarity and hope to everyone who encounters it.
