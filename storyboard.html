  <p> For my project I am making an interactive website/ application that serves the purpose of introducing the story of the Israel and Palestine conflict without bias. The people who will use it will be those looking to understand the conflict better and create their own understanding of what is going on. My illustration showcases the navigation through the main menu and how to use the buttons on the site. It will be a multi-page site that involves interactions and stories. Through stories, users will receive first hand stories from people who are experiencing the conflict first hand. I think through this app, users will be able to have a more meaningful connection with what is going on on both sides and either make an opinion on which side to support or come to the conclusion that any given situation isn't black and white and there may not be a right and wrong side to this narrative.
