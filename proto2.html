        <br> </br>
        Q. What are the differences between ISraelis and Palestinians?<br></br>
        A. <em> The Israeli people are those who reside in the Israeli parts of Israel. They are a widly Jewish people and claim to have resided in the areas for centuries. The Israeli people technically have controll over all of the land area of Israel. The Palestinian people are those living in the areas of Palestine on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Palestinians are widly Muslim in faith.</em>
        <br> </br>
        Q. What is the conflict about? <br> </br>
        A. <em>The conflict is largely over land. The Palestinian people are fighting for their own state but Israel has been hesitant. A huge issue facing quick resolution is the distribution of land ownership between the two nations. The Palestinian people live in two main sections on either side of the country of Israel. Figuring out how to split up the land without making a fragmented nation and allowing the Palestinian people to move from one section of their country to the other poses a huge problem. Israel has offered solutions to Palestine but the Palestinians have repeatedly denied to settle for Israel's offers. </em>
        <br></br>
        Q. What side is America on?<br> </br>
        A. <em>The United States has openely and actively supported Israel in this conflict for years. The US sends millions of dollars worth of aid every year to Israel. The United States seems to support Israel because the US is dedicated to protecting democracy and has unfairly demonized Muslim Nations. </em>
