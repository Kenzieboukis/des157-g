  .         This is Jordan. Jordan is a fourth year International Relations student at the University of California Davis. Jordan is very passionate about politics and social justice issues. She always wants to do what is best and hopes to create solutions for conflicts all over the world when she goes to law school for International Law. Unfortunately, Jordan has a hard time understanding the contested borders between Israel and Palestine. She wants a place where she can recieve completely unbiased facts about the conflict and also hear stories from both sides. This site will help Jordan feel like she has a better grasp on the conflict and help her make decisions one which side, if one, she is going to support. Having the facts without bias will help Jordan become a better lawyer and human.
