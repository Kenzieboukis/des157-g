  <h2> Israel and Palestine </h2>

  <p>The Israeli and Palestinian conflict over the land in Israel is one of the most talked about yet least understood conflicts in the world. A fight that has been going on for years, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict has one of the most contested histories our world has ever seen. The fight is between Jewish Zionist group and the Palestinian nationalist group who both lay claim to the same area of land.
	The disputed territory is over a small portion of the country of Israel. A group of Arab people, who call themselves Palestinians, want to establish an independent state and break away from Israeli rule. The conflict began when Jewish people fleeing Europe during World War II wanted to have a place to live and they decided on the historically Jewish Area of Israel. This land, however, was mostly Arab at the time and war between the groups has raged since then.
	<br></br>The West Bank and Gaza are primarily Palestinian occupied, however, Israeli military has asserted themselves in this area to limit the lives of the Palestinian people. Solutions to this issue are to create two autonomous states, one Israel and one Palestine in order to appease both sides. However, both sides somewhat favor a one state solution in which the land is either all Palestinian or all Israeli. Personally, I believe the one state solution is selfish and is the reason for the ongoing conflict in this region. Another reason no peace treaties have been made is due to a lack of faith in one another. One extremist group on the Palestinian side calls for the destruction of Israel and Israel fears that if they release land to the Palestinians their state might be overthrown. On the otherside Israel has long ignored the needs of the Palestinian people and has militarily occupied their lands for decades and the Palestinians do not believe that the Israeli people will actually leave or be willing to strike a fair deal.
  <br></br>
	The United States send huge amounts of aid to Israel each year, i.e. $3 billion to be exact. The reason for America’s ties to Israel are somewhat ambiguous. Some people believe that it is due to America wanting to support democracy in the Middle East. Some believe it is due to the countries deep rooted Islamophobia and fight against Arab terrorism. Either way, the United States without a doubt takes huge strides in order to support Israel.
	Many Israeli people are beginning to move to the West Bank-land meant for Palestinians. This is weakening the Palestinian group and making their struggle stronger. Many Israeli people want to take the land completely from the Palestinians and maintain Israeli control. Now in the West Bank, Palestinians are banned from using ‘Israeli Only’ roads which force them to take longer routes that lead them to checkpoints. At these checkpoints, Palestinian people are often robbed and sometimes murdered. This is a huge case of injustice against the Palestinian people.  According to Vice, most international lawyers believe these Israeli settlements are violating the Fourth Geneva Convention.
  <br></br> Personally, I do no think that either side is innocent nor do I know which side is worthy of support. I often see Palestinian classmates arguing for the rights of the Palestinian people. They even go on to describe it as hostile conditions and borderline genocide. I do not understand why a two state treaty hasn’t been agreed upon. It seems like  a selfish thing for the Israelis to try to keep Palestine as part of their country. I personally think that the Israeli people are persecuting the Palestinians to an unfair amount. However, I do not want this to necessarily be a political piece (except it may turn into that) and instead I just want to present unbiased facts and allow people to make decisions on their own.
