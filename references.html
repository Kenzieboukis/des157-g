  <p> The main purpose of this page is to explore the idea of peace within the warring groups of Palestinians and Isreali peoples. The page is designed for scrolling and there is also an area to see quotes and inspirations as a sort of header. There is a header navigation bar that can take one to different areas of the site. If I were to make a site with this same sort fo information I would want to open on an interactive map and the front page of scrolling would have mich more ahrd facts about the conflict. This site seems to be unbiased toward either side which is a model I would like to practice. Although I have opinions on the contention, I believe creating an easy to use site where people can learn the cold hard facts and make their own decision doesn't exist and would be immensly beneficial. The elements in this site, though possibly useful, are not asthetic. I believe there is a certain amount of interactivity that could help users understand more about the conflict at hand.

  <p> The Jewish Voice for Peace is a more biased telling of the Israel and Palestinian conflict. The page promotes peace in the Middle East but more from a Jewish perpective instead of a truly unbiased one. The page has a good intro video and when ones scrolls there are a lot of Q and As  on the home page. The site is actually very well made expect the intro doesn't look as good as the rest of the scrolling does. There is also no interactivity in this page that I would like to put into mine. I really like the Q and A style format that the creators used on their homepage. I think it would be a good idea if I have an entire Q and A page on my site. I also like the simple and elegant colors the creators used in their creation of their site. I think it is a good way to lend important information to their readers.
